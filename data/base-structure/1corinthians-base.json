  "big_picture_notes": "1 Corinthians is a rhetorically sophisticated letter addressing reported problems (chs. 1–6) and written questions (chs. 7–16). The second movement is organized by the perì de (‘Now concerning…’) markers (7:1, 7:25, 8:1, 12:1, 16:1). Literary glue includes extended metaphors (agriculture/construction ch. 3; body ch. 12; athlete ch. 9), antithesis (worldly wisdom vs. cross; knowledge vs. love), temple/body motifs (3:16–17; 6:19–20), and the love chapter (13) as a regulating centerpiece for gift praxis. The argument culminates in the doctrine of the resurrection (ch. 15), grounding all ethics in the historical gospel.",
