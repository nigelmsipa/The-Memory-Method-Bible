Literary glue includes diatribe with an interlocutor, inclusio around righteousness (1:17; woven through 1–8), OT catenae (3:10–18; ch. 4), and the law–faith–Spirit progression. The Spirit’s agency climaxes in ch. 8; chs. 9–11 resolve Israel’s place; chs. 12–15 translate doctrine into lived ethics.",
