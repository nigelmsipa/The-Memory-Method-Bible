The book juxtaposes God’s burning wrath against Israel’s spiritual whoredom with His persistent, tender love, developed through wordplay (children’s names), vivid metaphors (half-baked cake, treacherous bow, empty vine, dew), and historical allusions (Exodus, Baal Peor, Gilgal, Gibeah). The structure is rhetorically driven with abrupt shifts in speaker and tone, bound together by the leitmotifs of whoredom, ‘knowledge of God,’ return, and the name Ephraim.",
