  "big_picture_notes": "Jude is a tightly constructed, single‑chapter polemical letter in classic Hellenistic form (salutation 1–2; body 3–23; doxology 24–25). Structural cohesion comes from pervasive triplets (hendiatris), aggressive historical typology (Israel/angels/Sodom; Cain/Balaam/Korah), and an inclusio of ‘kept’/‘keeping’ (1, 21, 24). The narrative arc moves from intended topic → urgent call to contend (3–4) → proof of certain judgment for intruders (5–16) → final exhortations to the faithful (17–23), concluding with a preservation‑focused doxology.",
