  "big_picture_notes": "Ecclesiastes is a poetic-philosophical monologue by Qoheleth framed by a narrator's prologue (1:1-2) and epilogue (12:8-14), forming an inclusio via 'Vanity of vanities! All is vanity.' The central glue is הֶבֶל (hevel) — vanity/breath — alongside refrains such as 'striving after wind,' 'under the sun,' and the positive counter-theme: God's gift to eat, drink, and find enjoyment in toil. Internally, the monologue cycles through a first-person empirical quest (chs. 1–2), broad observations ('I saw...') about times, oppression, wealth, wisdom, and justice (chs. 3–8), and a final exhortation to live wisely in light of certain death (chs. 9–12). Scenes are complete thought-units: poems, proverb clusters, and short essays.",
