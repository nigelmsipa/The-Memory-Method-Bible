Literary center of gravity is the Christological Hymn (1:15–20). The letter combats syncretistic error by antithesis: Christ’s ‘fullness’ and sufficiency vs ‘empty deceit’ and elemental spirits (2:8, 20). Glue includes repeated ‘in him/through him’ anaphora, the rooted/built‑up motif (2:7) mirrored by ‘put off/put on’ (3:8–12), and a movement from ontology (who Christ is) to praxis (how believers live).",
