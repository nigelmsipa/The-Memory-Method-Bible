Literary devices: generational structure (Joseph's generation fades, Moses' generation rises), multiplication motif (Israel multiplies despite oppression), repeated complaint-provision cycles (water, food, enemy), and the development of Moses from refugee to leader. This story establishes both the problem (slavery) and its resolution (God's deliverance and community formation).",

Devices: Divine instruction for assembly sequence (not arbitrary); 'on the first day of the first month' (calendar significance); assembly steps ordered (ark, curtain, table, lampstand, altars, basin); specific placement directions (east-west orientation); anointing oil for furniture sanctification (makes objects holy); priestly anointing (makes persons holy); assembly creates functioning covenant community structure."

Devices: Step-by-step placement (ark first—covenant center), then table (sustenance), lampstand (light), altars (sacrifice and prayer), basin (purification); outer courtyard assembly; all furniture positioned precisely ('Moses put the table...lampstand...altar of incense...'); 'just as the LORD commanded' (obedience emphasis); careful placement shows architectural purpose—each item serves covenant theology; Moses' completion note marks transition to divine action."
