  "big_picture_notes": "1 Timothy is a pastoral letter structured by two major charges to Timothy, framed by greeting and benediction. It blends hortatory imperatives with didactic instruction to combat false teaching and to establish godly order in the church. Literary glue includes the contrast between sound teaching and myths/genealogies, the ‘mystery of godliness’ (3:16) as theological center, and an inclusio of charge→exposition→practice that returns to a climactic final charge. The flow moves from personal commission (ch. 1) to corporate worship and leadership (chs. 2–3), then to practical godliness against error (chs. 4–5), culminating in warnings about wealth and a solemn oath‑charge (ch. 6).",
