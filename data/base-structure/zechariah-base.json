Chapters 1–8 are dated encouragement oracles centered on a cycle of eight night visions (chs. 1–6), capped by a crowning sign‑act and followed by prose oracles on fasting and future blessing (chs. 7–8). Chapters 9–14 shift to undated, apocalyptic 'burdens' (maśśāʾ) marked by oracle formulas (9:1; 12:1), focusing on judgment/salvation, the humble king, shepherd imagery, repentance/cleansing, and the climactic Day of Yahweh. Literary glue: dating formulas, the interpreting angel motif, repeated 'Thus says Yahweh of hosts,' and the burden/oracle markers framing the second half.",
