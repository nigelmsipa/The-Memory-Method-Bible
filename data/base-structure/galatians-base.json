  "big_picture_notes": "Galatians is a forensic rhetorical defense of Paul’s apostleship and the gospel of justification by faith against Judaizers. Structure: Personal Defense (chs. 1–2) → Theological Proof (chs. 3–4) → Practical Exhortation (chs. 5–6). Literary glue: Law vs Promise, Flesh vs Spirit, Abraham motif, and the striking omission of a thanksgiving (1:6) signaling urgency. Devices include sustained allegory (4:21–31), rapid rhetorical questions (3:1–5), and analogies (will/covenant 3:15; guardian/son 4:1–7).",
