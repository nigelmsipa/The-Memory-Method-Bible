  "big_picture_notes": "Micah is structured as a tripartite cycle—Judgment (1–3), Restoration (4–5), and Reconciliation (6–7)—framed by three major 'Hear' oracles (1:2; 3:1; 6:1). The literary engine is the covenant‑lawsuit (rîb), moving repeatedly from indictment to sentence to salvation. Devices include dramatic contrast (predatory rulers vs. future shepherd‑king), paronomasia on town names (1:10–16), dialogic exchanges among God, prophet, people, and personified Zion, and climactic ethical summary (6:8). The book resolves in a confessional lament and doxology (7:7–20), affirming Yahweh’s covenant loyalty.",
