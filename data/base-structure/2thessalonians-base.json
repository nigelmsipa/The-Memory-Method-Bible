The letter clarifies eschatological confusion by establishing a chronology (apostasy and the Man of Lawlessness precede the Parousia), encourages perseverance under persecution, and disciplines idleness. Literary glue: repetition of standing firm, affliction/justice, Parousia language, and Paul’s autograph as authentication (3:17) against forged reports (2:2).",
