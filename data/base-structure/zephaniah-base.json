Its macro-structure forms an hourglass: universal judgment concentrated on Judah/Jerusalem (ch. 1), broadened to oracles against the nations (ch. 2), then inverted to a global cleansing and joyful restoration for a humble remnant (ch. 3). Literary glue includes repeated Day-of-Yahweh language (1:7, 14, 18), 'woe' markers, catalogues of sins and punishments, and a decisive hinge at 3:9 that pivots from devastation to salvation. The book closes with an inclusio of joy, presence, and renown (3:14–20).",
