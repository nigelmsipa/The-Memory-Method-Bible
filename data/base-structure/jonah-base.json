  "big_picture_notes": "Jonah is a prophetic novella structured by a two‑cycle parallel (call→response→divine action) with a chiastic center in Jonah’s psalm (ch. 2). It contrasts repentant pagans (sailors, Ninevites) with a resistant prophet through pervasive irony. Literary glue includes the repeated commission (1:2; 3:2), the refrain of divine preparation ('Yahweh prepared' 1:17; 4:6–8), and the theme of Yahweh’s compassion (ḥanan/ḥamal). The book culminates in a rhetorical question that presses the scope of divine mercy.",
