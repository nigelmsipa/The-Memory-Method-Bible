  "big_picture_notes": "James is a Christianized wisdom letter employing diatribe, vivid imagery, and catchword links to weave a ring‑like composition. Its backbone is moral dualities (hearing/doing, rich/lowly, earthly/heavenly wisdom, faith/works), with brief, self‑contained exhortation units ideal for memorization. The argument cycles from steadfastness under trial to impartial love and active faith, to tongue/wisdom/peace, and concludes with prophetic warning and pastoral practices (patience, prayer, restoration). Inclusios include 1:1 with 5:19–20 and repeated catchwords (peirasmos, glōssa, dikaios).",
