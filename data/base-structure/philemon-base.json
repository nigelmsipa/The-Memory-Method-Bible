  "big_picture_notes": "Philemon is a single, tightly argued supplicatory epistle in classical Greco‑Roman form: Salutation (1–3), Thanksgiving/Prayer (4–7), Body of appeal (8–21), and Closing (22–25). Paul persuades by laying relational groundwork, appealing ‘for love’s sake’ rather than commanding, offering personal guarantee for Onesimus’s debt, and ending with confident assurance. Literary glue includes paronomasia on ‘Onesimus’ (useful) and an inclusio built on koinōnia/partner language (vv. 6, 17), with repeated love/joy terms framing the request.",
