Its macro‑architecture is heptadic: letters to seven churches, then three septets (seals, trumpets, bowls), framed by the epistolary prologue and the new‑creation epilogue. Recapitulation cycles, OT allusions, parataxis, and inclusios/chiasms shape the vision. Titles like ‘Alpha and Omega’ frame the whole (1:8; 22:13). Scene divisions often follow speaker changes, vision formulae (‘I saw…’), or completed symbolic units.",
