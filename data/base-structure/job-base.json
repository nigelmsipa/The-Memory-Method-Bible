  "big_picture_notes": "The Book of Job is a masterfully constructed work of wisdom literature, framed by a prose prologue (chs. 1-2) and epilogue (42:7-17) around a dense poetic core (3:1–42:6). The primary literary tension arises between the retributive simplicity of the prologue's test and the profound disputation of the poetic dialogues, where Job challenges any easy equivalence between suffering and sin. The structure moves from Job's initial lament (ch. 3) into three ordered dialogue cycles (chs. 4-14, 15-21, 22-27), whose breakdown signals the failure of human wisdom, highlighted by the wisdom interlude (ch. 28). Job's final monologue (chs. 29-31) presents his legal summation; the unexpected Elihu speeches (chs. 32-37) introduce a refining perspective; and YHWH's whirlwind speeches (chs. 38-41) reframe the debate through creation's vastness. The book resolves as the prose epilogue restores Job and judges the friends, revealing providence that refines rather than abandons the righteous.",
