  "big_picture_notes": "The Psalter is a curated anthology of 150 distinct poems, songs, and prayers organized into five Books (Pss 1–41; 42–72; 73–89; 90–106; 107–150). Each of the first four Books ends with an explicit doxology and the whole concludes with Psalm 150 as a grand doxology. Within this five‑book structure, smaller editorially placed collections appear (e.g., Davidic psalms, Sons of Korah, Asaph, Songs of Ascents). For memorization, each psalm is a complete literary unit (scene). Longer psalms should not be arbitrarily split, though internal strophes (often marked by Selah, speaker/audience shifts, or thematic turns) can serve as day‑by‑day chunks. Books I–V trace a theological arc from the struggle of the righteous king (I), through the Elohistic collection (II), the national crisis (III), the answer 'YHWH reigns' (IV), to the climactic Hallelujah and pilgrim ascent (V).",
