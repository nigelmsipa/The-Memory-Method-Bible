  "big_picture_notes": "2 Corinthians is an emotionally charged apologia where Paul defends integrity and apostolic authority while seeking reconciliation. The letter coheres through the paradox that divine power is displayed in human weakness (1:3–11; 4:7–12; 12:7–10). Macro‑movement: A) Reconciliation and New‑Covenant ministry (1–7), B) The Jerusalem collection (8–9), C) Polemical defense against the ‘super‑apostles’ (10–13). Literary glue: repeated paraklēsis (comfort/encouragement), boasting redefined as boasting in weakness, peristasis catalogs, and Spirit/new‑covenant contrasts (letter vs Spirit).",
