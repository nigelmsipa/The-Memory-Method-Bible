  "big_picture_notes": "Joel is a tightly structured, unified prophecy moving from a present ecological disaster (locust plague) and a liturgical call to repentance (1:1–2:17) to Yahweh’s answering word of restoration, Spirit outpouring, and universal judgment (2:18–3:21). The Day of Yahweh motif (1:15; 2:1, 11, 31; 3:14) is the central hinge connecting near crisis to eschatological climax. A sustained metaphor depicts the locust horde as an unstoppable army (2:2–9). The pivotal speaker change at 2:18 marks the narrative turn from lament to salvation. Agricultural devastation and promised abundance (1:10–12 versus 2:24; 3:18) form an inclusio.",
