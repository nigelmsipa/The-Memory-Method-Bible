  "big_picture_notes": "John presents a high‑theological narrative built as legal testimony so that readers may believe (20:31). The macro‑structure is framed by the Prologue (1:1–18) and Epilogue (21), with two central panels: the Book of Signs (1:19–12:50) and the Book of Glory (13:1–20:31). Literary glue includes irony/misunderstanding, double entendre (e.g., anōthen ‘again/from above’), I‑AM sayings, key vocabulary (life, light, know, witness, believe), and the recurring ‘hour’ motif. Signs are paired with discourses to reveal identity; the Passion shows glory in sovereign self‑giving.",
