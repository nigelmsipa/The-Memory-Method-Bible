  "big_picture_notes": "Judges chronicles Israel's moral and spiritual decline between Joshua's death and the monarchy. The book's primary framework is a tragic, downward-spiraling cyclical formula: Sin → Oppression → Crying Out → Deliverance (by a judge) → Rest. This cycle repeats with increasing degradation, from good judges like Othniel to deeply flawed ones like Samson. The book is bracketed by a Prologue (1:1–3:6) and Epilogue (17:1–21:25). The key refrain—'In those days there was no king in Israel; everyone did what was right in his own eyes'—frames the epilogue and implicitly argues for righteous monarchy. The judges themselves fail to fill the leadership vacuum, pointing forward to Samuel and David.",

Contrast with true shrine at Shiloh."}
