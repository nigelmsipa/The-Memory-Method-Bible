Its macro-structure moves from the Lord’s theophany/indictment (ch. 1) to a kinetic siege vision (ch. 2) and a woe‑driven denunciation and aftermath (ch. 3). Literary glue: vivid, kinetic imagery (chariots, torches, flood), mockery/sarcasm in judgment, and the juxtaposition of divine vengeance on foes with comfort for Judah (1:7, 12–15). Note: some traditions number 1:15 as 2:1; thematically it concludes the first oracle of comfort.",
