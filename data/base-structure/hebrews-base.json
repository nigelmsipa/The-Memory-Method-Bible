  "big_picture_notes": "Hebrews reads as a sustained theological homily framed by epistolary opening/closing. Its macro‑method is comparatio and a fortiori (‘how much more’), arguing Christ’s supremacy over persons (angels, Moses, Aaron) and institutions (priesthood, covenant, sanctuary). The discourse alternates exposition and exhortation, signaled by ‘Therefore’ transitions, and is saturated with LXX citations (esp. Ps 110; Jer 31). Leitmotifs include ‘better’, ‘rest’, ‘perfect’, and priestly themes, moving from the Son’s person to His work, and finally to practical endurance and ethical living.",
