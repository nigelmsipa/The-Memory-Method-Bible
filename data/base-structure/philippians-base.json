The Christ‑Hymn (2:5–11) is the theological/ethical hinge: Paul’s circumstances → exhortation (1:12–2:4), grounded in Christ’s example (2:5–11), then applied (2:12–30), followed by polemical warning and pursuit of Christ (ch. 3), and practical instruction/thanks (ch. 4). A sharp rhetorical turn at 3:2 re‑engages urgency. Glue: partnership (koinōnia), unity/humility, and imitation.",
