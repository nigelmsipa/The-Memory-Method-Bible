  "big_picture_notes": "Proverbs is a divinely inspired anthology—multiple curated collections whose superscriptions provide the text‑driven framework. Its governing poetic device is parallelism (antithetical, synonymous, and synthetic), and its thematic center is 1:7: 'The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge.' The book moves from extended, thematic discourses (chs. 1–9) to dense couplets (10:1–22:16), to 'sayings of the wise' akin to ANE instruction (22:17–24:34), to a Hezekian Solomonic appendix (25–29), and concludes with Agur (30) and Lemuel (31). For memorization, treat each discrete discourse or themed proverb cluster as a scene; do not arbitrarily split complete poems.",
