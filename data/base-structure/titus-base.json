  "big_picture_notes": "Titus is a pastoral letter in standard Hellenistic epistolary form: salutation (1:1–4), main didactic body (1:5–3:11), and conclusion (3:12–15). The core movement interweaves practical ethics with dense theological summaries, producing a chiastic feel: false teachers → household/communal ethics → grace/renewal rationale → civic conduct → warning against factious persons. Literary glue includes ‘sound doctrine’ vs false teaching, frequent ‘for/gar’ rationales, and the repeated emphasis on ‘good works’ as the fruit of God’s saving action (2:14; 3:1, 8, 14).",
