  "big_picture_notes": "Joshua functions as the hinge between the promise of the Torah and the possession in the rest of the Old Testament. Its three-part structure (Conquest, Division, Covenant) masterfully balances epic narrative with geographical lists. The entire book is held together by the theme of fulfillment—God keeps His covenant promise to give the land. The book is profoundly Deuteronomistic: obedience leads to victory; disobedience leads to defeat. The phrase 'Be strong and courageous' links Joshua's leadership to Moses', while the deaths of Joshua and Eleazar formally close the conquest generation.",
