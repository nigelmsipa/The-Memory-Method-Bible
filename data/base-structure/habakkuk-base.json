  "big_picture_notes": "Habakkuk is a compact prophetic dialogue/theodicy framed by a title (1:1) and a liturgical colophon (3:19). Its movement is chiastic (A–B–C–B'–A'): Complaint 1 (1:2–4) ↔ Answer 1 (1:5–11); Complaint 2 (1:12–2:1) ↔ Answer 2 with Five Woes (2:2–20); Resolution in a prayer‑psalm (3:1–19). The hinge is 2:4 ('the righteous shall live by his faith'), contrasting the proud with the faithful. Literary glue includes courtroom‑style questions, repeated lexemes (ḥāmas/violence; see/vision; judgment), formal 'woe' oracles, and the Divine Warrior theophany in ch. 3 that transforms fear into rejoicing.",
