  "big_picture_notes": "Paul’s final will-and-testament letter blends intimate encouragement with urgent instruction. The structure cycles through perseverance, suffering, and Scripture’s authority, unified by direct vocatives to Timothy and memorable metaphors (soldier, athlete, farmer, vessels) in ch. 2. A core contrast opposes unfaithful teachers (2:17–18; 3:1–9) to faithful models (Paul’s life, 3:10–11; and the sacred writings, 3:15–17). The move from a solemn public charge (4:1–5) to personal postscript (4:9–22) closes with farewell and benediction.",
