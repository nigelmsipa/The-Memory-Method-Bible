  "big_picture_notes": "Often considered Paul’s earliest extant letter, 1 Thessalonians follows a modified Hellenistic epistolary pattern: Salutation (1:1), extended Thanksgiving/Personal Narrative (1:2–3:13), Hortatory/Didactic instructions (4:1–5:22), and Conclusion (5:23–28). Literary glue includes the triad faith–love–hope (1:3; 5:8), frequent second‑person plural address, family metaphors, and the programmatic turn ‘Finally, then’ (4:1) from narrative to instruction. Eschatological hope in the Parousia motivates the ethical exhortations.",
