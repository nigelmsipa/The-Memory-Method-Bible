  "big_picture_notes": "The Book of Nehemiah is an ancient first-person memoir (the \"Nehemiah Memoir\"). Its journal-like voice binds the book together around one aim: restoring Jerusalem's physical and spiritual integrity. The narrative runs on a work-and-opposition framework: every advance (commission, wall, reforms) meets mockery, conspiracy, or internal corruption. A recurring literary device is Nehemiah's signature, ejaculatory prayers (2:4; 4:4-5; 5:19; 6:9; 6:14), culminating in the book's final plea, \"Remember me, O my God, for good\" (13:31). Structurally, Nehemiah alternates narrative with administrative lists (action: chs. 1-2, 4-6, 8-9, 13; lists/reports: chs. 3, 7, 10, 11-12). The movement proceeds from physical restoration (wall, chs. 1-7) to spiritual restoration (covenant, chs. 8-10) to social restoration (community order, chs. 11-13).",
