  "big_picture_notes": "The Book of Esther is a finely crafted Hebrew narrative, often described as a historical novella or diaspora story. Its defining literary feature is a meticulous chiasm where the first half (chs. 1-5) mirrors the second half (chs. 7-10), pivoting on the peripeteia of 6:1 (the king's sleepless night). Recurring motifs include feasting (ten banquets), royal edicts, concealment (Esther's identity), irony, and reversal: Haman is hanged on his own gallows, the decree of death becomes a day of triumph, and the powerless are exalted. God's name is never mentioned—a deliberate choice highlighting providence by structure and timing: apparent coincidences, the sleepless night, and perfectly timed reversals function as the theology of the book, revealing God's invisible but decisive governance for His covenant people.",
