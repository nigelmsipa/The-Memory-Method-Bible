Six (often reckoned seven) disputations create a dialogical, confrontational tone, reinforced by a chiastic arrangement (opening love/offerings ↔ closing remnant/Day of Yahweh) pivoting on covenant fidelity and justice. Literary glue: repeated epithet 'Yahweh of hosts,' pervasive rhetorical questions, and the assertion–objection–response structure that exposes spiritual blindness and summons covenant loyalty.",
