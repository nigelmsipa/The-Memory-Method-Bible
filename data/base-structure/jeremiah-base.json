The macro‑structure is modular: large narrative superscriptions mark major collections, while oracle formulas ('The word of the LORD came…', 'Thus says the LORD') are the key scene markers—each scene a single, complete divine speech or report ideal for memorization. The MT places the Oracles Against the Nations at 46–51 (LXX relocates after 25:13), underscoring the book’s editorial history. Thematic glue: relentless covenant lawsuit against Judah, the 'enemy from the north' motif, the prophet’s confessions, and a hope‑center in the Book of Consolation (30–33). Memorize by literary units (oracles), not chronology.",
