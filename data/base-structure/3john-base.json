  "big_picture_notes": "3 John is a brief Johannine letter in classical Hellenistic form (salutation → body → closing) that advances a single pastoral appeal: walk in the truth by practicing hospitality toward gospel workers, while rejecting the self‑exalting inhospitality of Diotrephes. Literary glue centers on ‘truth’ (repeated) and the practical ethic of hospitality, arranged as a diptych contrasting Gaius (faithful host) and Diotrephes (arrogant rejecter), with Demetrius commended as a reliable witness. The family imagery (‘elder’, ‘beloved’, ‘friends’) fosters intimate exhortation and unity.",
