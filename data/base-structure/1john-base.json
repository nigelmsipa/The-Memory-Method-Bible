  "big_picture_notes": "1 John advances assurance through spiral progression (ringing repetition) across three interlocking themes: Light/Righteousness (obedience), Love (fraternal charity), and Truth (confession of the Son). The discourse cycles via antithetical parallelism (light/darkness; God/world; truth/error) and repeated markers (‘By this we know…’, ‘My little children…’) that frame tests of life: doctrinal (Jesus Christ come in the flesh), moral (keeping commandments), and social (loving the brothers). Inclusios tie the work together (1:4 with 5:13; knowledge/knowing), while purpose is pastoral: confident fellowship and eternal life.",
